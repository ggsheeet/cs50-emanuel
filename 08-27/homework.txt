1. Create a calculator!
  - Don't worry, not a single calculator that can add/subtract/multiply/divide
  - Create one function for each. Each function should take 2 user inputs (at least):
    * One function should output the sum of those inputs
    * One function should output the subtraction of those inputs
    * One function should output the multiplication of those inputs
    * One function should output the division of those inputs
  - No extra requirements but you are welcome to add whatever features you like! (like printing "Luis is the best teacher" or whatever you want of course...)
  
2. Create a dice roller!
  - Write a function that when it gets executed, it rolls a dice and outputs a number between 1 and 6
  - For this, it is important you look up python's "random" library and how to use "randint".
  - No extra requirements but I encourage you to get creative with what you know! The text editor is your canvas and code is your art!
